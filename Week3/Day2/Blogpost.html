			<h1>Technology to help teachers do what they do best</h1>
				<h2>Insights from Googlers into our products, technology, and the Google culture</h2>
					<p>June 27, 2016 By <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/">Mark Johnson</a></p>
						<p>Great teachers inspire us, listen to us and learn from us; they bring the most mundane subjects to life. Technology can help great teachers do what they do best—stimulating minds and fostering skills in the next generation—and make learning even more rewarding for students. So we’re excited by the updates and improvements to our tools for the classroom we’re announcing this week at the ISTE conference, one of the largest education technology gatherings in the world.<img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-raNgzo1yfrI/V3FH0-FmCvI/AAAAAAAASmQ/nn93MpvTG28W16zQuf5IsLfmJdITJaNtgCLcB/s640/Expeditions-TeacherView-noCopy.gif">
							Sharing information on the classroom’s big screen helps students learn from one another. But today, students have to physically connect their computers to the projector to share their screens with the class. To open classroom collaboration and bring projecting into the 21st century, we’re announcing Google Cast for Education, a free Chrome app that lets students and teachers share their screens wirelessly from everywhere in the classroom, no new hardware required. Cast for Education carries video and audio across complex school networks, has built-in controls for teachers, and is integrated with Google Classroom.</p>

							Getting feedback helps students learn and teachers teach. But grading tests and quizzes is time-consuming; teachers often have to take time away from other tasks to do it, and if it’s not done promptly, everyone misses out on the opportunity to learn from the things students got wrong. Starting today, Quizzes in Google Forms will grade multiple choice and checkbox questions automatically—so teachers can spend less time grading work and more time teaching.
